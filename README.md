# pl0compiler
PL/0 compiler for IBM 701

Entire program is in a single file. Should compile and build with any C compiler. Tested only with Visual Studio.

Assembler output is in "out.a".

You'll need an actual IBM 701 or a 701 emulator to run it. No 701s exist, but you can find an emulator at
basepath.com/701.
